This project is my implementation of this refactoring kata :

and in particular this part :
[https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/java](https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/java)

This refactoring has been done in about 1 day. This project has been done to demonstrate my skills in programming. It is not at all a reusable project and the refactoring could go further.

I have choosen a goal for this refactoring in order to be efficient : add the possibility to implemenent a rules inference to the original project. And I have added a very slight one.

I have learned the programming language "java" in 2003. For example, this programming language had no generics and no lambdas at this time. And I can program in fewer others programming languages with different paradigms.

So I hope this code will show that my skills in this programming language are up to date and more generally that my skills in programming are good.

## Installation and Usage

As said, it is not at all a reusable project. So open this project with your favourite IDE with a [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) plugin. And navigate into the code and launch the unitary tests. That's all.

You can also use the package manager to test and install it.

```bash
mvn install
```
